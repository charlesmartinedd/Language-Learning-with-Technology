## Step 2: Push Your Code

Copy and paste these commands in your terminal (one at a time):

```bash
cd "C:\Users\charl\AI Projects\projects\Language-Learning-with-Technology"

# Add the remote repository (use YOUR actual repository URL from GitHub)
git remote add origin https://github.com/charlesmartinedd/Language-Learning-with-Technology.git

5. Click **"Save"** (if prompted)

## Step 4: Wait for Deployment

1. Go to **"Actions"** tab in your repository

3. Wait ~2 minutes for completion (green checkmark âœ“)

## Step 5: Access Your Live Website!

Your website will be live at:

**Issue: 404 Page Not Found**

## Updating Your Website

Every time you push changes to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild and redeploy your site:

```bash
# Make your changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Your update message"
git push origin main

# Wait 2 minutes â†’ Live!
```
