## 4. CONSISTENCY CHECKING

### Status: ⏳ AWAITING CONTENT

### Terminology Consistency
Create a glossary of preferred terms:

| ✅ Use This | ❌ Not This |
|------------|------------|
| artificial intelligence | A.I., AI (unless in acronym list) |
| language learning | language acquisition (unless technical) |
| student | learner, pupil (unless specific context) |
| technology | tech (unless informal) |
| chapter | section (for main divisions) |
| e-learning | eLearning, e-Learning |
| ChatGPT | Chat GPT, chatGPT |

### Style Guide Compliance

#### Headings
- Title Case for H1
- Sentence case for H2-H6
- No periods at end
- Hierarchical (no skipping levels)

#### Lists
- Use parallel structure
- Consistent punctuation
- Logical ordering

#### Citations
- Format: (Author, Year)
- Full references at end of chapter
- Consistent citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago)

#### Voice
- Academic but accessible
- Active voice preferred
- Second person for direct address ("you")
- Third person for general statements

### Automation
```bash
# Create custom linter rules
cat > .textlintrc <<EOF
{
  "rules": {
    "terminology": {
      "terms": [
        ["artificial intelligence", "AI"],
        ["machine learning", "ML"]
      ]
    }
  }
}
EOF

textlint --rule terminology content/**/*.md
```
