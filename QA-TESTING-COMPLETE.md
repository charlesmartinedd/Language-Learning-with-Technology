npm run build:epub    # Generate EPUB
npm run build:docx    # Generate DOCX
npm run build:course  # Build course module
```

### Step 3: Run QA Tests
Execute comprehensive testing:
```bash
# Run all tests
bash scripts/run-all-tests.sh

# Or run individual tests
bash scripts/test-content-quality.sh
bash scripts/test-accessibility.sh
