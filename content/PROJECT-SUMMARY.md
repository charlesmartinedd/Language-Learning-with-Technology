## Notes for Completion

### Tone Consistency
- Maintain encouraging, knowledgeable parent-friend voice
- Use "I" for personal experiences, "you" for advice
- Balance research authority with practical accessibility
- Include 1-2 real examples per major section

### 2025 Technology Standards
- All app mentions: check 2025 availability
- Hardware: current generation only (Quest 3, Vision Pro, not Quest 2)
- AI: emphasize GPT-4 and newer, not GPT-3
- Pricing: 2025 subscription models
- Safety: current parental control standards

### Practical Emphasis
- Every chapter ends with action steps
- Include templates, checklists, sample schedules
- Real parent examples (can be anonymized)
- Budget-conscious options in every category
- "You don't need X" is as important as "You should use Y"
